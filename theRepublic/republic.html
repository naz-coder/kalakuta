      <p>Afro beats legend, Fela Anikulapo Kuti got married to 27 women in one day back in 1978 in what was seen as a very daring move. According to reports, Fela decided to make the bold move after rumours began to filter the air that he was holding the women in his band as captives.</p>

        Kalakuta Republic is derived from a spell Fela spent in prison in 1974 on suspicion of possessing weed. He was held in a communal cell which his fellow prisoners jokingly called Kalakuta Republic - in Swahili, kalakuta means “rascal.” The tag had a ring to it which appealed to Fela.<br><br>
        Kalakuta Republic was first situated in the Lagos suburb of Surulere, where Fela, his family and Afrika 70 lived until 1977, when the army burnt it to the ground. On February 18, some 1,000 soldiers sealed off the neighbourhood and broke down Kalakuta’s defensive perimeter fence. Residents were beaten with rifle butts and iron bars. Women were raped. Fela was beaten with particular viciousness and his 77 year old mother, a hero of Nigeria’s independence struggle, was thrown from an upstairs window, fracturing a leg (she died the following year from the trauma she had suffered).

        The Kalakuta Museum is managed by Fela’s son Kunle. Fela’s tomb is next to the house. Inside, the Museum hums with people and positivity. The walls are covered in historic photographs, posters, paintings, murals, album covers and newspaper cuttings. Some of Fela’s musical instruments are on show, including his brightly painted, signature tenor saxophone. <br> <br>It is possible to look into Fela’s bedroom, which is preserved as he left it – and still contains the refrigerator for his ice-cream, his snack of choice during an attack of the munchies. Rows of Fela’s shoes and shirts are on display along with stage suits, the fur coat he took on tours of Europe and the US, and even a few pairs of Speedo underpants, his preferred leisurewear. There is a rooftop café and visitors can stay the night in one of several air-conditioned, en-suite rooms.</p></div>
